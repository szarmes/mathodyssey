	Here are the files you will need to complete this assignment. Download the files below and first use the Kirchhoff's Rule Intelligent System Tutor (KRIT) System.  You will need to use the system for 1 hour to get full marks, if you want to take a break that is fine, but please leave the system open on your computer between uses so that you don't need to see the instructions again.  After you have used the system download and run the Post Use Questionnaire.  After this you will find a file called "KRIT_data.csv" in your User folder. Submit this file on connect to get marks for the assignment.
